= GitHub repos

The following repos exist on GitHub:

* `interloquio-playbook-local` -- contains the local Antora playbook, which is used during development.
* `interloquio-playbook-netlify` -- contains the Antora playbook that is used by Netlify to generate the public site.
Updates to this repo trigger Netlify to rebuild the Metathesis site.
* `interloquio-ui` -- contains the files for developing the UI bundle used by this site.
* `interloquio-ui-build` -- contains the UI ZIP bundle.
In theory storing zipped files on GitHub is not recommended but in this case it's convenient.
* `interloquio-doc-site-home` -- contains the `_home`  component of the docs site.
