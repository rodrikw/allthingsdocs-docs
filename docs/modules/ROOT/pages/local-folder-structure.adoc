= Local folder structure

On my local computer, I have the following structure (all within `C:{backslash}Users{backslash}__UserName__{backslash}Documents{backslash}`):

* `interloquio-playbook-local` -- The location of the local Antora playbook, which is used to generate the site from the local files during development.
* `interloquio-playbook-netlify` -- The location of the Antora playbook that is used to generate content on Netlify.
* `interloquio-site-local` -- the location of the output of the Antora local output.
* `interloquio-ui` -- The folder for developing the UI bundle for the Interloquio site.
* `source` -- folder containing all the site source files (AsciiDoc, images, antora.yml, and so forth).
This folder has subfolders for each of the site components: `_home` and `recommendations` at this stage.
Each component has a corresponding repository on GitHub.
